# Collatz Conjecture
The conjecture can be summarized as follows. 
Take any natural number n. 
If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. 
If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. 
Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1. The property has also been called oneness.
